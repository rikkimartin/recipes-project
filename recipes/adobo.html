    <h2 class="header">Cooking Directions</h2>
    <ol class="content list">
        <li><strong><em>Marinate the Pork:</em></strong> In a large bowl, combine the pork cubes with soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, chopped onion, whole peppercorns, and bay leaves. Mix well to ensure the pork is evenly coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight for best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Sear the Pork:</em></strong> Heat cooking oil in a large pan or pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the marinated pork pieces (reserve the marinade) and sear them until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. This step adds depth of flavor to the dish.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Simmer the Adobo:</em></strong> Pour the remaining marinade over the seared pork. Add water to the pot until the pork is almost covered. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the adobo simmer gently for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the pork is tender and the sauce has thickened slightly. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Adjust the Seasoning:</em></strong> Taste the adobo and adjust the seasoning according to your preference. You can add salt to taste and a bit of sugar if desired to balance the flavors. Remove the bay leaves and skim off any excess fat from the surface if needed.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Serve:</em></strong> Once the pork is tender and the sauce has thickened to your liking, remove the pot from the heat. Serve the pork adobo hot over steamed rice. Garnish with freshly chopped green onions or fried garlic flakes if desired.</li>
