    <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>Prepare the Tamarind Broth:</em></strong> If using tamarind pods, place them in a bowl and pour hot water over them. Let them soak for about 15-20 minutes, then use your fingers to break the pulp and extract the juice. Strain the mixture to remove any seeds or fibers. If using tamarind powder, dissolve it in hot water to create tamarind juice. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Boil the Pork:</em></strong> In a large pot, add the pork chunks and pour in the water. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Add Aromatics:</em></strong> Once the pork is boiling and the scum has been removed, add the quartered onion and tomatoes to the pot. Let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes or until the pork is tender.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Add Vegetables:</em></strong> Once the pork is tender, add the sliced radish and eggplant to the pot. Let it simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Add Tamarind Juice:</em></strong> Pour in the tamarind juice (extracted from tamarind pods or tamarind powder) into the pot. Stir to incorporate the sourness into the broth.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Season to Taste:</em></strong> Season the sinigang with fish sauce (patis) or salt and ground black pepper to taste. Adjust the sourness level by adding more tamarind juice if desired.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Add String Beans and Kangkong:</em></strong> Add the string beans to the pot and let it simmer for about 2-3 minutes. Then add the kangkong (water spinach) and cook for another 1-2 minutes until wilted.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Serve:</em></strong> Once all the vegetables are tender, and the flavors have melded together, remove the pot from the heat. Serve the Pork Sinigang hot in bowls with steamed rice on the side.</li>
